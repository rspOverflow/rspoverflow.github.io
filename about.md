# About Me

My name is nanoHeap. I'm also known as rspOverflow on GitHub.
I have been writing code since around 2018-2019.

Nowadays, I have been primarily been writing mostly in C/C++ but I started off with Python.
I also have experience with other languages including Java, Assembly, GDScript, and Lua.

Outside of programming, I really enjoy video games. I'm a big fan of sci-fi stuff
like Star Wars or anything Cyberpunk-related (especially Cyberpunk cityscapes).

As for pets, I really like cats.
